1. binary expressions, especially those in return <exp>
2. method calls
3. nested function calls ex: println!("", func2())
4. discrepancy between timeline annotations and code panel annotations
  RV1 expects timeline owners to be ordered hash1, hash2...
5. Need to order moves correctly (when giving then returning ownership on same line)
6. Return exp 
7. functions with multiple return expressions
