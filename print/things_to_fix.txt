1. binary expressions, especially those in return <exp> (FIXED)
2. method calls (FIXED)
3. nested function calls ex: println!("", func2()) (SOMEWHAT FIXED)
4. discrepancy between timeline annotations and code panel annotations
  RV1 expects timeline owners to be ordered hash1, hash2...
5. Need to order moves correctly (when giving then returning ownership on same line) (POSSIBLY FIXED)
6. Return exp (FIXED)
7. functions with multiple return expressions
8. RV1 bug: hover says mutable die on a staticDie event
9. Move rhs annotations into visit_expr and keep match_rhs to just relationship between lhs and rhs
10. What to with function calls as arguments (RV1 can't handle them rn)
11. A consideration: can't have variables with the same name as fields 
12. Have yet to handle struct reference fields (lifetimes)
13. Seperate annotation from event construction (FIXED)
14. Change mut ref hover message (mut refs cannot point to different pieces of data)
15: fix annotated gen source for lifetime parameters
